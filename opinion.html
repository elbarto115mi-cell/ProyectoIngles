              The truth is that philosophers like Aristotle, Plato, Kant and Socrates are quite important because their ideas still make sense today. For example, Socrates catches my attention because he always questioned everything and that makes one think that one should not conform to what they are told, but rather seek their own answers. I also find Plato interesting because he talked about a world of perfect ideas, and although it sounds a bit difficult, it helps to reflect that reality is not always what it seems.
<br><br>
Aristotle seems more practical to me, because he tried to explain things more logically and based on experience, and that connects with how we see science and knowledge today. And I feel Kant is more complicated, but what I understood is that he talked about acting correctly not only out of interest, but because it is what should be done. I relate this to the fact that people should have clear principles to live better in society.
<br><br>
In general, although they lived a long time ago, I think that what they thought still helps us understand ourselves and how we organize life in a community.

              At first, I didn't understand why we still talk about such old philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, Kant, or Socrates, I thought they were just textbook stuff, nothing to do with real life, but then I realized that many of the things they said are still true today.
              <br><br>
              For example, Plato spoke of justice as a balance, like each part of society doing what it should, and that makes sense because today there are many things that don't work out of selfishness or disorder.
              <br>
              Aristotle said that justice is giving everyone what they deserve, and that seems really fair to me. I mean, there are people who have nothing and people who have more than they deserve, and no one does anything.
              <br>
              Kant was harder for me to understand, but I kept that idea of ​​doing things because they're right, not because it suits you, and thinking about whether what you're doing would be right if everyone did the same.
              <br><br>
              And I love Socrates because he asked questions, didn't believe he was the owner of the truth, he just wanted to understand, and I think that's missing a lot. Now, people give their opinions without thinking, without listening.
              <br>
              For me, they still matter, maybe they don't have all the answers, but they make you think, and that's already a lot
