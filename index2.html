          <h2>Socrates and the Search for Truth</h2>
          <p>Socrates was a philosopher who never wrote books, but left a great mark on the way of thinking. His method of dialogue, known as maieutics, encouraged questioning and reflection in order to reach the truth. Rather than giving answers, he asked questions that led others to think for themselves.
        Today, this Socratic spirit is connected to the importance of critical education, freedom of expression, and the questioning of politics and justice. In the era of fake news and media manipulation, Socratic thinking is key for people to distinguish between truth and deception.</p>

          <h2>Plato and Justice in the Republic</h2>
          <p>Plato reflected in his work The Republic on justice, the ideal government, and social organization. His famous allegory of the cave represents the search for truth beyond appearances. For him, justice meant that each person fulfilled their role within society in a balanced way.
            Nowadays, his ideas remain relevant in debates on democracy, human rights, and political systems, especially in the face of problems such as inequality, corruption, and misinformation on social media. Plato also inspires discussions about the role of leaders: should the wisest govern, as he proposed, or should everyone have a voice in decision-making?   </p>

          <h2>Aristotle and Happiness as the Supreme Goal</h2>
          <p>For Aristotle, the goal of human life is to achieve “eudaimonia”, which can be translated as happiness or fulfillment, reached through the practice of virtue. This was not about momentary happiness, but about living a good and accomplished life.
            His teachings connect with modern well-being, with social movements that fight to improve quality of life, and with the importance of finding a balance between the material and the spiritual. Today, we can relate this to issues such as mental health, ethical education, and the search for inner peace in societies that often prioritize consumption and speed over reflection and harmony.</p>

          <h2>Kant and Human Dignity</h2>  
          <p>Kant stated that every human being must be treated as an end in themselves, not as a means to an end. His central idea was that every person has a dignity that cannot be negotiated or sacrificed.
        This principle has been essential for the development of human rights, the defense of equality, and the idea that justice must be impartial. Today, his ideas are reflected in struggles against discrimination, in the pursuit of gender equity, in the defense of minorities, and in the importance of a government based on ethical principles rather than individual interests. </p>

          <h2>Philosophy in Action: From Ideas to the Streets</h2>
          <p>Philosophy does not stay in books: many of its ideas have inspired social movements and protests throughout history.
<br>
<ul>
Socratic thought has inspired movements that defend freedom of expression.
<br>
Plato’s ideas on justice and good government have influenced reflections on democracy and modern politics.
<br>
Aristotle, with his vision of happiness, has been a foundation for movements seeking well-being and social rights.
<br>
Kant, with his defense of dignity, inspired the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and many current movements for peace and social justice.
<br>
</ul>
From classical Greece to our times, reflection on justice, freedom, and human dignity has been the driving force behind changes that transform the world, reminding us that ideas themselves can generate revolutions.</p>
