            <h1>Platón</h1>
            <p>Plato's Exact Burial Site Discovered
              Using advanced reading techniques (such as bionic vision, X-rays, and infrared), Italian researchers have deciphered more text from a 
              papyrus found in Herculaneum that describes the garden of the Academy of Athens as Plato's burial site.

              <br>
              New analysis of Platonic philosophical writing:<br>
              Fredrik Sixtensson recently published two articles: one in Classical Quarterly, analyzing why Plato uses weaving as a model of the state in the dialogue 
              Statesman, and another in Eranos, proposing a new interpretation of why slaves and foreigners residing in Athens were granted the right of isēgoria 
              (equality of speech).

            <h1>Aristóteles</h1>
            <p>Archaeological Evidence on Aristotle's School in Mieza, Greece
              In the region of Mieza, near Naoussa, in Macedonia, Greece, the first phase of research has been completed at the
              "Royal Gymnasium" where Aristotle taught Alexander the Great and other nobles. Terraces, architectural structures,
              porticos, palaestrae, and even writing instruments used by the students have been found. This helps reconstruct the physical context of Aristotle's education.

            “Aristotelistes” Project:
            <br>
            An ongoing project seeks to develop an open and inclusive platform containing the complete corpus of Aristotle's works. It would allow not only access to the texts but also collective contributions, encouraging participation from different types of users (academics, students, and the general public).
